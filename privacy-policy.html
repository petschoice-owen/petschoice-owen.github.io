This information is then used for identity theft and fraud.</p>

Meatiful will never ask you to send any personal details by email unless you have contacted Meatiful first. If you have not contacted Meatiful, please ignore any email claiming to be from Meatiful which asks for personal details, and let us know about it.</p>
